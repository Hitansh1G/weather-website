                    <p>What is this webpage?</p>
                    <p>This is a very basic webpage that tells users about the weather in any location in the world. It
                        uses data from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank"
                            >mapbox.com</a> and <a
                            href="https://weatherstack.com/" target="_blank">weatherstack.com</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>How does it work?</p>
                    <p>It's very simple. Click on the 'weather' tab. On this page the user will find an input box where
                        he/she can type in the location they want. Click the 'search' button beside the input box and
                        voil√†!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I followed the instructions, but got the weather information from
                        some
                        other
                        place. What can I do?</p>
                    <p>In cases like this, I suggest users be more specific with their queries. What does this mean?
                        Don't just type in the city name, try typing in the country's name as well.</p>
